# Finite-State-Machine
This is a programmed finite state machine meant to be used for applications in any machine simulation. For example, this finite state machine can capture the basic flow of an elevator system or even an operating system. This finite state machine simulation has functionality that makes it flexible in use across many disciplines.

The program uses a core data structure which suits this project well - graphs. To see results, run the driver ("fsm.py") and use the different functions of the Finite State Machine object to manipulate your object. You can verify/observe changes using function calls as well.
